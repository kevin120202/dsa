# Procedure bubble_sort(nums):
#     Set swapping to True
#     Set end to the length of nums
#     While swapping is True:
#         Set swapping to False
#         For i from the 2nd element to end:
#             If the (i-1)th element of nums is greater than the ith element:
#                 Swap the (i-1)th element and the ith element of nums
#                 Set swapping to True
#         Reduce end by one
